            <p><span class="dropCap-container"><span class="dropCap" text="W">W</span></span>hen rain falls on the great Contiental Divide of the Americas the water follows one of two paths. If it falls on the east face of the divide it runs and fills the SOMETHING SOMETHING. On the west face it fills rivers like the Rio Grande, A river that flows through the Southwest and Texas and gives water to some of the best green peppers in the world. These peppers go onto make extrodenary meals such as chile rellenos, salsas, and green chili.</p>
            <p>Green chili is something of a panacea for me. Growing up on the outskirts of the American Southwest. Green Chili, either alone or smothering a delcious burrito, has been a staple of the Southwest and the Rockies for centuries. It has warmed me up on cold winter days, cured me of disabling mornings after a long night out. It's a salty, rich and sometimes a little sweet indulgence that has helped me out in many a scenario.</p>
            <p>Peppers, much like potatoes and chocolate, are native to the Americas and have made impactful culenary changes to the world. It wasn't until after the expansion of europeans into the Americas that the pepper was introduced to the cuisine of Asia and Africa. Today we enjoy some form of pepper in most of the meals we enjoy, especailly the ones with heat (Specifically capsasin heat).</p>
            <blockquote>The versitility of Green Chili leads to confusion as it can be an uncooked product, a topping, or a meal iteself.</blockquote>
            <p>Peppers are found in a large amount of central american food each of which many of which are extrely delicious. Personally one of my favorite is Chili Verde con Cerdo of commonly known in Colorado and the southwest as Green Chili. This dish is as wonderful as it is versitle. It can be used as a standalone bowl full of chili for a cold winter evening or it can spice up another dish with some small variations to ingrdients and consistency.</p>
            <p>The versitility of Green Chili leads to confusion as it can be an uncooked product, a topping, or a meal iteself. This is mostly possible because it is a fairly basic meal as far as ingredients go, and can pair well with many other meals. You take a good helping of green produce, mix in some water (or chicken stock) with pork and cook it until the consistency is soft and the pork can be easily pulled apart. It's not completely unreasonible to have it as part of breakfast, lunch and then dinner.</p>
